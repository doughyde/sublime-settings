# sublime-settings

My saved settings for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is mainly for my own reference, but feel free to fork.

Key packages
* [sublime-github](): `cmd+shift+o` opens file in github
* Git: better git integration (blame, log, etc)
* GitGutter: indicate changed lines
* [Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime): Many cool features
* RSpec & RubyTest: `cmd+r` and `shift+cmd+r` run tests in current file and current test, in Sublime
* CoffeeScript, Sass, Haml
* AdvancedNewFile
* SideBarEnhancements
* Package Control

Key settings & shortcuts
* `cmd+b` is go to definition (inspired by PyCharm/RubyMine)
* Show full file path in titlebar
* Spaces, not tabs, trim trailing spaces, force single newline
* Bold folders, normal filenames
